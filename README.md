In this project, I analyzed a dataset from Excel of a sales store. My main goal was to extract some quick insights regarding the company's sales from the dataset using Excel. I utilized Excel's PivotTable and several functions throughout my analysis. Finally, I created a dashboard in Excel to showcase visualizations of the key insights.

I created a final Power Point presentation. I ask you to open that file and read through the presentation to see how I explored this data. Thank you!
